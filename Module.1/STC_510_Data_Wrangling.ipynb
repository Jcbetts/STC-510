By removing the process of food production from the everyday lives of people, positive and negative externalities from these processes become invisible. As Fusillo and Beloian discuss (1977), this relatively new homogenization of food selection reduces basic nutrition knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\nProgram: The Tucson Village Farm offers the First Farmers Camp, a three-week program developed to instruct children aged from seven to ten years old on the basics of food nutrition and farming. The program offers all students a course component and either a visual field trip component or an experiential farming component.  \\n\\n\\n\\nProgram theory: Research on the effects of kinesthetic learning is not new (Suydam, 1977), and, as Joshi and Mishra (2022) more recently explore, for disciplines that align practice with recollection, like math, activity-based teaching shows clear benefits over sole lecture-based learning. The Tucson Village Farm recommends that for every two hours a student spend receiving nutritional information, they spend an hour in the field practicing farming techniques. By following a lesson with an activity, children recall better the information taught and are better equipped to move forward with more challenging concepts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dependent variable in the study: The study will give all students in the program a pre-test and a post-test with one group only receiving classroom exposure and a field trip to a farm for visual reinforcement and another group receiving classroom exposure with an additional experiential farming activity. We will also survey families on grocery store purchases one month prior to the class, the weeks when the classes are being held, and one mon\\tth after the class.\\n\\n\\n\\nMotivation of the study: Tucson Village Farm is funded primarily on donations and below-cost lessons. The experiential portion of the program is far more costly to maintain and provide than the in-class lessons. This study's purpose is to quantify the benefits, if any, of the activity-based coursework and inform donors and potential grant programs of the need and benefit of these activities. \\n\\n\\n\\nProgram inclusion criteria: For one Summer, students who register for the course will be randomly placed into either the classroom only class or the classroom plus activity class. The only restriction is that the participant must be no younger than seven years old and no older than ten years old. Participants will likely live exclusively in the Tucson metro area.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tFor this study, we are interested in measuring two outcomes: the improvement of a student’s knowledge in elementary nutrition and whether that information has positively influenced eating habits for children, and their families. Ideally, the course utilizes not only the abstract benefits of proper nutrition education but also connects healthy food to the satisfying experience of growing food in a safe and engaging environment. \\n\\n\\tStudents will be randomly selected into two groups. All students will be placed in the same two-hour class. The class will go over age-appropriate nutrition information. After each class, students selected for additional audio-visual education will visit farms for an additional two hours to see various aspects of food growth. The other half of the course will engage in actual farming practices where they will participate in farming techniques.\\n\\n\\tTo evaluate nutritional habits, all families participating in the program must fill out a weekly survey one month prior to the course beginning. The survey will have an encompassing list of forty pre-selected foods to choose from. There will also be opportunities to write about foods that the family feel are not represented on the list. Families will fill out how often those foods were eaten each week. The total for each food will be tallied for monthly consumption. Families will fill out the same survey during the month their child or children are in the class and a month after they have completed it. \\n\\n\\tThere are quite a few issues with self-reporting diet habits, which Martin Hagger (2015) summarizes as a disconnect between how a respondent subjectively experiences habits and how habits are represented in surveys. Additionally, there are also potential issues with memory recollection, estimation, and potential blatant misrepresentation. Given that this is a fairly primitive study, the purpose of these surveys is meant for general fact finding for our donors. We are interested primarily in exploring how the families or our participants view themselves, not necessarily on exactness.\\n\\n\\tThe population that self-selects into the program is also an issue. A family attracted to the program may be quite different from a family that does not have the interest, or time, to send their children to the program. We must acknowledge again that this design is more about gathering information about our current participants than a generalized evaluation.\\n\\n\\tIn addition to the food consumption surveys, students will take a test before the program begins and after the program ends.  The first test will check nutrition knowledge taught to children during second grade, which, in Arizona, is a grade started at the age of eight. We confirmed with the Tucson Unified School District that our test covers material most students would have seen. The purpose of the pre-test is to set a baseline appropriate for families that self-select to enter the program. \\n\\n\\tThe post-test is meant to measure any differences between the baseline and the program, as well as any differences between the passive-learning only class and the class with an experiential component. If a meaningful difference exists, the program will be better advised on how to plan future classes, and the best way to invest in a curriculum that produces the most effective results. Certainly, age differences will matter, but the randomization of students between the two groups, as well as the pre-test and post-test should account for those differences.\\n\\nTheory of Change\\n\\n\\tFor the Tucson Village Farm, the program aims to add a positive, reinforcing voice for children to hear when talking about nutrition. At the ages the program serves, there are several voices children hear, and all of them our out of their control. According to Leslie Lytle’s (1994) study, children receive nutritional information primarily from parents, and at least 53% of interventions not already covered in the elementary curriculum are facilitated by schoolteachers (pg. 25). In the same study, Lytle discusses the trend of cutting nutrition education from curriculum as a cost-saving measure (pg. 48). As schools decrease the time devoted to nutrition, low-cost programs become crucial to assist in filling the education gap. \\n\\n\\tChildren take lessons from families, teachers, and media and are given few alternatives. Their sense of food and nutrition are contained primarily within that closed sphere. Tucson Farm Village takes some of the elements that children inherit from this structure and developed an experiential education program to reorient some of those concepts. One inference is that the workshop imparts skills and knowledge to children. With the information and skills developed in the class, children should be equipped with a new skillset. Part is recognizing the importance of the environment required to yield crops. Another part highlights the complex conditions required to feed many people. \\n\\n\\tWith the specific skillset and more grounded understanding of food, another assumption is made that infers the knowledge and skills gained from the intervention materializes into real-world effects. Children will take home some of the food grown, and a certain percentage is given to local food banks, emphasizing a complex response to food insecurity. A change in family eating habits and a thoughtful consideration to how land is used in urban spaces are also desired outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeasurement, Estimator, and the Counterfactual\\n\\n\\tThe dependent variable will be the students’ nutritional knowledge prior to starting the program. A pre-test will be distributed the first day of the program. Based on the students performance on the test, we will have a baseline for both the control and the treatment group.  \\n\\n\\tFor timeframe, we utilize two types of tests. The first is a survey of family eating habits one month before, the one month during the intervention, and one month after the intervention. The tests are meant to address the immediate effects of the program. Surveys on eating habits sent months or years after the survey are beyond the scope of the shareholders’ interests, and subject to extreme attrition and unreliability. For the pre-post test, we follow Anthony Worsley’s 2002 study on nutrition knowledge and food behavior, in which he states:\\n\\n\\tWe need to pay greater attention to the development of children’s and adults’ knowledge \\tframeworks (schema building) via group and experiential learning. There should be more \\tstudies of children’s nutrition knowledge and food beliefs and how they develop their dietary \\tpatterns (S584).\\n\\nMaking inferential claims about nutritional habits based on early education is incredibly complicated and prohibitively expensive to perform. What our stakeholders want to know is whether it is worth investing in an experiential farming component for our relatively short summer program. Which again, diminishes the universal applicability of our study, but is still valuable.\\n\\n\\tOur research design is set up so that we are directly measuring the treatment-on-the-treated. While we are also measuring and comparing performance of those not treated, our research design clearly distinguishes between those treated and those not treated. There may be students who do not receive the full treatment, e.g., miss a class period due to illness or stop attending the program, but class sizes are manageable enough that we can decide whether to exclude them from the study, or note any significant partial treatments. \\n\\nLiterature Review\\n\\n\\tFor the supporting assumption that experiential learning cultivates local geographic knowledge, which in-turn contributes to a stronger understanding of food security, I read a study lead by Ghaida Alrawashdeh, Samantha Lindgren, Manuel Reyes, and Sar Pisey. In their study, they sought to measure what impact experiential learning through a school curriculum had on their perceptions of a career in agriculture. The authors use the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) as their theoretical framework for their study, and by creating a context to link careers with experiential school programs, they believe there will be a causal link between the school program and a child’s willingness to enter the agriculture career field (Alrawashdeh, 5). They used a pre-post reflexive design to surveyed students from a specific region in rural Cambodia that offered a one-year program to teach ecologically friendly agriculture techniques (Alrawashdeh, 6). Teachers selected students to take a survey and those same students were given the same survey one year after the program was completed. Outcomes were measured by survey responses. They found that willingness for a career in agriculture was a secondary response to how the experiential learning program taught students about the impacts agricultural practices have on the local community (Alrawashdeh, 12).\\n\\n\\tTo explore the impact of community gardens on dietary habits, I used a study by Katherine Alaimo, Elizabeth Packnett, Richard Miles, and Daniel Kruger. In their study, they surveyed eating habits of residents in Genesee County, Michigan. They partnered with Speak to Your Health! Community Survey to identify areas where new community gardens have developed and query people who self-identified as participants in a community garden and compared their survey results with people in Genesee County who do not identify as members of a community garden (Alaimo, 98). This survey is a sort of post-only estimator. The way it is set up sounds more like a general one-time fact-finding survey to measure fruit and vegetable intake as well as using it as an opportunity to ask other health-related questions, like smoking habits. Outcomes were measured using the survey data.\\n\\n\\tDavid and Catherine Katz led a more measured study for elementary school children. Three schools received a new nutrition curriculum, and two schools did not receive the intervention. All five schools were part of Independence, Missouri. The three schools receiving the intervention had students participate in five mini lessons, which demonstrated the struggles of eating well, explaining how to find nutritious food, and showing the differences between more and less processed food (Katz, 22). The study wanted to measure whether giving students a better understanding of how to read food labels would meaningfully change dietary habits. The researchers used a pre-post test on food label knowledge as well as a survey on dietary habits. The post-test showed significant improvement of reading food labels, so the intervention was successful in teaching that information, but no significant change in dietary habits. Outcomes were measured with a post-test and follow-up survey to both the treatment and control groups.\\n\\n\\tFor the primary outcome, we will use a diff-in-diff design to measure knowledge retained from the the students who visited the farm (control), and the students who spent time working to grow vegetables in the field (treatment). Diff-in-diff is the best estimator for a few reasons, the first being the varying range in ages for children. By comparing the difference between the treatment group tests with the control group tests, we will determine what, if any, impact the experiential farming experience has over a second lecture-style field trip. While the children are randomly assigned into the control or treatment group, the diff-in-diff estimator further removes non-identical behavior between children in each group. \\n\\n\\tRandomization and diff-in-diff help to ensure the sample populations are either identical or have controlled for differences. All students attend the same first two-hour class component. So, the main difference will be how students who visited a farm will perform on the post-test compared to students who spent time farming. The diff-in-diff model helps to factor in secular trends for both the control and treatment group. Given the steps taken at the outset, the comparison group reflects the average group of children who would self-select into the program. We will want to pay careful attention to our sample size to ensure we have “happy” randomization, and we may elect to perform a matching to ensure the randomization is actually random.\\n\\n\\tOne issue to address: all students attend the class, but the control has a farm visit, which the treatment group does not participate in. We opted to include this farm visit for the control group because it is a low-cost alternative to farming that reinforces the content learned in the class. We did not want the treatment group to have the added benefit of more time with the material and the experiential learning activity. While we believe the added field trip helps mitigate the extra time the treatment group receives with the material, we also acknowledge it weakens the inferential power of the post-test comparison.\\n\\nCompeting Hypotheses\\n\\n(1) Selection / Omitted Variable Bias +0\\n\\n\\tOne of the major concerns for this study is going to be selection bias. The family that seeks out an extracurricular activity specifically to learn about nutrition and farming is not going to represent the general population, even if students are randomly selected into the treatment and control. If the sample is too small, and we expect it to be, randomizing is not going to remove the bias. Family motivation and influence will be important, and it is likely true that students electing to participate in the program will have a different level engagement with the program than the general population. Because we are testing on a few questions, we will be able to apply a Bonferroni correction to further measure omitted variables.\\n\\n(2) Non-Random Attrition +1\\n\\n\\t Because the study takes place in such a small area, during a specific time, it could be that events in the area prevent people from participating in the program. Something like excessive heat warnings, vacations, or other environmental challenges can alter the participation rate, and because the study is so short, they can have a large impact on the study. We have tried randomized those in the control and treatment, and are administering a pre-test and a post-test, so we believe we will be able to monitor and measure non-random attrition.\\n\\n(3) Maturation +1\\n\\n\\tMaturation likely is not an issue because the duration of the study is fairly quick – three months from pre-test to post-test, and the intervention itself is only a month long. Because we also have a control group to compare with and a pre-test, we should be able to control for any maturation that does happen during the study.\\n\\n(4) Secular Trends +1\\n\\n \\tSecular trends are not likely to be an issue because of the duration of the study, and the pre-test, post-test controls for changes that may occur, however unlikely.\\n\\n(5) Seasonality +0\\n\\n\\tSeasonality is an issue for this study. The program is only offered during the Summer, which not only affects the sample population, but also the experience of the treatment and the vegetables grown during the treatment. Our comparison group also tests during the same season, influencing the results. We could run the intervention in month-long intervals year-round to control for seasonality, but that is beyond the scope of this particular intervention.\\n\\n(6) Testing Effects +0\\n\\n\\tThe time between tests within thirty days, and we want to measure specific nutrition and dietary habits. We are not controlling against a group that does not receive testing and while the descriptive surveys are informative, they should not be used in place of the post-test.\\n\\n(7) Regression to the Mean +0\\n\\n\\tBecause we are randomizing children into both a control and treatment, neither group should be represented by the top or bottom of the distribution. However, participation in the program is self-selected. While the pre-post tests will have a control to measure against, we believe the very specific population will affect the mean.\\n\\n(8) Time-Frame of Study +1\\n\\n\\tThe time-frame for the study is appropriate for the participants and has been confirmed by the literature review. The immediate knowledge and skills obtained by the intervention should be immediately demonstrated, and there is no long-term test.\\n\\n(9) Measurement Error +1\\n\\n\\tThough the population is not as robust as desired, the diff-in-diff test mitigates for those issues. \\n\\n(10) Intervening Events +1\\n\\n\\tThe program was able to run without any external interference. With the exception of a couple unavoidable absences for illness, all students participated in and completed the program.

Additionally, there are also potential issues with memory recollection, estimation, and potential blatant misrepresentation.

At the ages the program serves, there are several voices children hear, and all of them our out of their control. According to Leslie Lytle’s (1994) study, children receive nutritional information primarily from parents, and at least 53% of interventions not already covered in the elementary curriculum are facilitated by schoolteachers (pg. 25). In the same study, Lytle discusses the trend of cutting nutrition education from curriculum as a cost-saving measure (pg. 48). As schools decrease the time devoted to nutrition, low-cost programs become crucial to assist in filling the education gap. \n",
            "\n",
            "\tChildren take lessons from families, teachers, and media and are given few alternatives. Their sense of food and nutrition are contained primarily within that closed sphere. Tucson Farm Village takes some of the elements that children inherit from this structure and developed an experiential education program to reorient some of those concepts. One inference is that the workshop imparts skills and knowledge to children. With the information and skills developed in the class, children should be equipped with a new skillset. Part is recognizing the importance of the environment required to yield crops. Another part highlights the complex conditions required to feed many people. \n",

            "\tWith the specific skillset and more grounded understanding of food, another assumption is made that infers the knowledge and skills gained from the intervention materializes into real-world effects. Children will take home some of the food grown, and a certain percentage is given to local food banks, emphasizing a complex response to food insecurity. A change in family eating habits and a thoughtful consideration to how land is used in urban spaces are also desired outcomes.\n",

            "\tFor the supporting assumption that experiential learning cultivates local geographic knowledge, which in-turn contributes to a stronger understanding of food security, I read a study lead by Ghaida Alrawashdeh, Samantha Lindgren, Manuel Reyes, and Sar Pisey. In their study, they sought to measure what impact experiential learning through a school curriculum had on their perceptions of a career in agriculture. The authors use the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) as their theoretical framework for their study, and by creating a context to link careers with experiential school programs, they believe there will be a causal link between the school program and a child’s willingness to enter the agriculture career field (Alrawashdeh, 5). They used a pre-post reflexive design to surveyed students from a specific region in rural Cambodia that offered a one-year program to teach ecologically friendly agriculture techniques (Alrawashdeh, 6). Teachers selected students to take a survey and those same students were given the same survey one year after the program was completed. Outcomes were measured by survey responses. They found that willingness for a career in agriculture was a secondary response to how the experiential learning program taught students about the impacts agricultural practices have on the local community (Alrawashdeh, 12).\n",
            "\n",
            "\tTo explore the impact of community gardens on dietary habits, I used a study by Katherine Alaimo, Elizabeth Packnett, Richard Miles, and Daniel Kruger. In their study, they surveyed eating habits of residents in Genesee County, Michigan. They partnered with Speak to Your Health! Community Survey to identify areas where new community gardens have developed and query people who self-identified as participants in a community garden and compared their survey results with people in Genesee County who do not identify as members of a community garden (Alaimo, 98). This survey is a sort of post-only estimator. The way it is set up sounds more like a general one-time fact-finding survey to measure fruit and vegetable intake as well as using it as an opportunity to ask other health-related questions, like smoking habits. Outcomes were measured using the survey data.\n",
            "\n",
            "\tDavid and Catherine Katz led a more measured study for elementary school children. Three schools received a new nutrition curriculum, and two schools did not receive the intervention. All five schools were part of Independence, Missouri. The three schools receiving the intervention had students participate in five mini lessons, which demonstrated the struggles of eating well, explaining how to find nutritious food, and showing the differences between more and less processed food (Katz, 22). The study wanted to measure whether giving students a better understanding of how to read food labels would meaningfully change dietary habits. The researchers used a pre-post test on food label knowledge as well as a survey on dietary habits. The post-test showed significant improvement of reading food labels, so the intervention was successful in teaching that information, but no significant change in dietary habits. Outcomes were measured with a post-test and follow-up survey to both the treatment and control groups.\n",
            "\n",
            "\tFor the primary outcome, we will use a diff-in-diff design to measure knowledge retained from the the students who visited the farm (control), and the students who spent time working to grow vegetables in the field (treatment). Diff-in-diff is the best estimator for a few reasons, the first being the varying range in ages for children. By comparing the difference between the treatment group tests with the control group tests, we will determine what, if any, impact the experiential farming experience has over a second lecture-style field trip. While the children are randomly assigned into the control or treatment group, the diff-in-diff estimator further removes non-identical behavior between children in each group. \n",
            "\n",
            "\tRandomization and diff-in-diff help to ensure the sample populations are either identical or have controlled for differences. All students attend the same first two-hour class component. So, the main difference will be how students who visited a farm will perform on the post-test compared to students who spent time farming. The diff-in-diff model helps to factor in secular trends for both the control and treatment group. Given the steps taken at the outset, the comparison group reflects the average group of children who would self-select into the program. We will want to pay careful attention to our sample size to ensure we have “happy” randomization, and we may elect to perform a matching to ensure the randomization is actually random.\n",
            "\n",
            "\tOne issue to address: all students attend the class, but the control has a farm visit, which the treatment group does not participate in. We opted to include this farm visit for the control group because it is a low-cost alternative to farming that reinforces the content learned in the class. We did not want the treatment group to have the added benefit of more time with the material and the experiential learning activity. While we believe the added field trip helps mitigate the extra time the treatment group receives with the material, we also acknowledge it weakens the inferential power of the post-test comparison.\n",

            "(1) Selection / Omitted Variable Bias +0\n",
            "\n",
            "\tOne of the major concerns for this study is going to be selection bias. The family that seeks out an extracurricular activity specifically to learn about nutrition and farming is not going to represent the general population, even if students are randomly selected into the treatment and control. If the sample is too small, and we expect it to be, randomizing is not going to remove the bias. Family motivation and influence will be important, and it is likely true that students electing to participate in the program will have a different level engagement with the program than the general population. Because we are testing on a few questions, we will be able to apply a Bonferroni correction to further measure omitted variables.\n",
            "\n",
            "(2) Non-Random Attrition +1\n",
            "\n",
            "\t Because the study takes place in such a small area, during a specific time, it could be that events in the area prevent people from participating in the program. Something like excessive heat warnings, vacations, or other environmental challenges can alter the participation rate, and because the study is so short, they can have a large impact on the study. We have tried randomized those in the control and treatment, and are administering a pre-test and a post-test, so we believe we will be able to monitor and measure non-random attrition.\n",
            "\n",
            "(3) Maturation +1\n",
            "\n",
            "\tMaturation likely is not an issue because the duration of the study is fairly quick – three months from pre-test to post-test, and the intervention itself is only a month long. Because we also have a control group to compare with and a pre-test, we should be able to control for any maturation that does happen during the study.\n",

            "(4) Secular Trends +1\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "\tSeasonality is an issue for this study. The program is only offered during the Summer, which not only affects the sample population, but also the experience of the treatment and the vegetables grown during the treatment. Our comparison group also tests during the same season, influencing the results. We could run the intervention in month-long intervals year-round to control for seasonality, but that is beyond the scope of this particular intervention.\n",

            "\tThe time between tests within thirty days, and we want to measure specific nutrition and dietary habits. We are not controlling against a group that does not receive testing and while the descriptive surveys are informative, they should not be used in place of the post-test.\n",

            "(7) Regression to the Mean +0\n",
            "\n",
            "\tBecause we are randomizing children into both a control and treatment, neither group should be represented by the top or bottom of the distribution. However, participation in the program is self-selected. While the pre-post tests will have a control to measure against, we believe the very specific population will affect the mean.\n",

            "\n",
